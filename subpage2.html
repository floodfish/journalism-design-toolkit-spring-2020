         This is the logo I made on Illustrator for JSOC, or Journalism Students of Color. Learning to use Illustrator was difficult. 
<br/>
     We learned Photoshop first and I was surprised that Illustrator is a lot different. 
         <br/>
        I made this logo by typing the letters with a font I liked and then morphing the shapes. 
         <br/>
        I chose colors that complimented each other and to play in to how they contrast, I tried to make a drop shadow. 
         <br/>
        This assignment was a bit difficult because of how I'm unfamiliar with Illustrator. 
        <br/>
        But, I'm glad I know some basic functions in case I find myself wanting to use Illustrator in the future.

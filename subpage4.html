        Last semester I was in a Green Roof Ecology class. After learning about green roofs, we had to turn in a final project.
        <br/>
        My group decided our project should be a video documentary showing the benefits of green roofs in NYC.
        <br/>
        We interviewed different experts in the field and filmed green roofs around NYC.
        <br/>
        Writing a script and making choices about the video was difficult to do at times.
        <br/>
        But, I think it turned out well and I could see myself making more documentaries in the future.

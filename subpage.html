        The photo on the left is the original image and the photo on the right is the same image edited in Photoshop.
        <br/>
        For this assignment, we took a bunch of different photos for the sole purpose of learning how to edit them in Photoshop. 
        <br/>
        By messing around with the many different settings, I was able to bring some light back to this very dark photo. 
        <br/>
        From this assignment, I learned that editing an underexposed image is easier than editing an overexposed one.

        This was my favorite part of the Photoshop assignment. The photo on the left is the original and the one on the right
        <br/>
        is after I went crazy in Photoshop. I really enjoyed learning about all the different effects and tools that Photoshop offers. 
        <br/>
        Although I probably won't edit photos like this during my time as a journalist, 
        <br/>
        I still like messing around in Photoshop and making distorted images like this.

        Best uses for Photoshop:
        </br>
        <ul>
  <li>Color correct images</li>
  <li>Crop images</li>
  <li>Combine text and images</li>
  <li>Combine multiple images</li>
</ul>
